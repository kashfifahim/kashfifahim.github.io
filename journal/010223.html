        <ul>
            <li>Asking for a Friend: Are the posts on CodeAcademy's Forum written by bots?</li>

            <li>
                Someone on CodeAcadmey's discord server asked for a simple application.
            They are manually changing the boolean value of a property in an xml file from true to false, and vice versa.
            They are tired of opening the file, scrolling all the way to the end of the file, finding the attribute then changing it before finally saving the file.
            They want a solution where they can pick the file, choose the value they want the property to have and get on with their life.
            </li>

            <li>Yeah, so I spent the afternoon tinkering with the problem. What did I learn?
                <ul>
                    <li>I learned about parsing an xml site using the python package beautiful soup</li>
                    <li>I learned how to open a file, read/write permission to the file using python's built in os package.</li>
                    <li>I learned a bit about regular expressions as a means of solving this problem.</li>
                    <li>From my point of view the simplest solution would be to use the find and replace function built into python's string objects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                But I want to make this solution a web application.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I want a form where the user selects the file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I want the user to change the value from true to false as easily as those green radio buttons on our phones.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                So I then started looking at how a simple flask application works.
            </li>

            <li>
                I need to add the back-end engineering pathway to my daily agenda.
            </li>
